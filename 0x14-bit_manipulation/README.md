The following tasks were undertaken during my study of software engineering at the alx-software engineering program. The focus was familiarisation with bit manipulation tasks.

Task 0 - A function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int.
Task 1 - A function that prints a binary representation of a number.
Task 2 - A function that returns the value of a bit at a given index.
Task 3 - A function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index.
Task 4 - A function that sets the value of a bit to 0 ata given index.
Task 5 - A function that retunrs the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another.
Task 6 - A function that checks the endianness.
Task 7 - Finding a password for a program.
